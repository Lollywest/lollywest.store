## Intro to Lollywest

Lollywest is a creative and fan-centric hub where artists unveil decks, wraps, and sponsorship opportunities to enhance financial support and deepen fan interaction. The Lollywest leaderboard prominently showcases top sponsors and artists, determined by the worth of their sponsorship credits. Each transaction generates sponsorship credits that can be utilized to qualify for the yearly Lollywest incentive payout.


## How does it Work?

No platform has ever truly acknowledged the credit fans deserve. Despite their admiration for artists and the music they create, fans haven't partaken in their accomplishments. Lollywest changes this dynamic; through Deck and Wrap releases, fans now experience significantly heightened levels of engagement, both online and in person.


Lollywest offers fans and artists three different ways to connect:

Decks:

> Decks represent bundles of perks with a restricted quantity available for fans to acquire. Typically, Decks hold a higher value compared to Wraps and offer a more substantial number of sponsorship credits.

Wraps:

> A Wrap constitutes a subscription-based package of perks. These packages, offered continuously by artists to their fan base, include more sponsorship credits compared to Sponsor packs, and they are renewed on a monthly basis.

Sponsorships:

> Sponsor Options do not encompass direct perks from either the artist or Lollywest. However, they do provide fans and the community with an opportunity to become eligible for the Lollywest payout and to potentially receive additional optional perks from the artists.

We're just getting started. As the landscape of music and arts evolves, so will we. Lollywest is not just a platform but an ongoing journey where every artist's dream is validated, and every fan's voice is heard. We invite you to join us on this journey and redefine the world of arts, one sponsorship at a time.
